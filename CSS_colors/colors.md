# CSS Colors

## HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model 

The value hsl(293, 100%, 98%) represents a color defined using the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness 色相、饱和度) color model. This model is often used in CSS for specifying colors in a way that's intuitive and easy to adjust.


- Hue (H): Defines the type of color (e.g., red, green, blue).
- Saturation (S): Adjusts the intensity (100% = full color, 0% = gray).
- Lightness (L): Modifies brightness (100% = white, 0% = black, 50% = pure hue).

Sample: hsl(293, 100%, 98%)

- 293 (Hue): This is the color's base tone, measured in degrees on the color wheel (0 to 360).
293° corresponds to a purple or magenta hue.

- 100% (Saturation): This defines the intensity or vividness of the color.
100% means the color is fully saturated (no gray mixed in), making it as vivid as possible.

- 98% (Lightness): This controls how light or dark the color appears.
98% is very close to white, meaning the color will appear as a very light purple or pastel shade.
