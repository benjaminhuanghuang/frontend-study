## css display
The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.
- display: none vs visibility: hidden
  display: none an element behaves like it is completely deleted
  visibility: hidden doesn’t remove an element completely

- display: block: Take full-width (100% width) by default, Each gets displayed in a new line , Width & height properties can be set, Can contain other block or inline elements
- display: inline : Don’t accept width or height properties, and top-bottom margin
- display: inline-block: width & height properties can be set, or we can think of a block-level element, that doesn’t have to start with a new line.
