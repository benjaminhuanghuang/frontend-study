## Things change. Sorry.

• Your bootcamp taught you Flexbox in 2015 because of browser support.
• Bootstrap used Flexbox because of browser support.
• Grid was designed for web page layouts. HTML tables, floats, and Flexbox were not designed for web page layouts.
• Grid is the layout solution we'll be using in CSS going forward.

## Grid is best for

• A series of boxes that are the same width
• Layouts that span across rows and/or columns
• Siblings that need to overlap or cover each other
• This should be your default layout method
