## Things change. Sorry.

• Your bootcamp taught you Flexbox in 2015 because of browser support.
• Bootstrap used Flexbox because of browser support.
• Grid was designed for web page layouts. HTML tables, floats, and Flexbox were not designed for web page layouts.
• Grid is the layout solution we'll be using in CSS going forward.
