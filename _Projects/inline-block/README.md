## display: inline
- for elements having inline display, you `cannot` define height or width.
- It automatically adjust its height and width to content. add content will increase its width


## display: block
- for elements having block display, you `can` define height and width.
- Block element always starts on a new line.
- By default it occupies full line space if you don't define width.

## display: inline-block
- Like inline element it does not start on a new line.
- Like block level element, height and width can be defined.
